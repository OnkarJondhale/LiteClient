# LiteClient 🚀

**LiteClient** is a lightweight, high-performance API testing tool that runs directly in your browser as a Chrome Extension. It is designed for developers who need a fast, privacy-focused alternative to heavy desktop applications like Postman or Insomnia.

### Why LiteClient?
- **CORS-Free Testing:** By running as an extension with `host_permissions`, LiteClient bypasses browser security restrictions (CORS) automatically, allowing you to test any API.
- **Privacy First:** Your data stays on your machine. No cloud syncing of your sensitive API keys or request history.
- **Minimalist Design:** Built with Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS for a clean, distraction-free interface.
- **New Tab Experience:** Opens in a full browser tab for maximum screen real estate.
